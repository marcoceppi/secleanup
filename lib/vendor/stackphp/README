web applications and command-line utilities.

 2. Running the test suite

1. Generating documentation

Generating documentation for Stack.PHP is very simple and straightforward.
Stack.PHP uses Doxygen <http://doxygen.org> for generating documentation from
comments in the source code. Simply make sure Doxygen is installed and run the
following command in the directory containing the Stack.PHP files:

  doxygen

This will generate the documentation and place it in a folder 'doc' in the
current directory. Documentation will be generated in both HTML and LaTeX
format.

2. Running the test suite

Stack.PHP comes with a test suite that puts the source files through an
exhaustive set of tests to make sure all methods and classes are working as
expected. You can run this test by switching to the 'tests' directory and
running:

  php run_tests.php

The test may take up to a minute or so to run and will produce output that
either indicates that all tests passed or that an error occured in one of the
classes.
